Raven is a tool to be used alongside VS Code that helps users to visualize and navigate their Java projects. It does this by generating a high level view of any Java projectâ€™s classes, methods, and attributes in a class diagram, allowing for extremely easy navigation of the codebase without having to dig through folders and files. Users can jump to any part of their codebase in VS Code by navigating this graph, so you can think of Raven as an alternative for a file explorer when working in a Java project.
