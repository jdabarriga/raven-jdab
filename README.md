## What is Raven?
Raven is a tool to be used alongside VS Code that helps users to visualize and navigate their Java projects. It does this by generating a high level view of any Java project‚Äôs classes, methods, and attributes in a class diagram, allowing for extremely easy navigation of the codebase without having to dig through folders and files. Users can jump to any part of their codebase in VS Code by navigating this graph, so you can think of Raven as an alternative for a file explorer when working in a Java project.

#### Try the Demo:
Don't have Java files handy? Click the **"üöÄ Try Demo"** button to see Raven in action!

The demo showcases a complete Vehicle Management System with:
- **Abstract Classes**: `Vehicle` base class with common properties
- **Interfaces**: `Drivable` and `Maintainable` for different capabilities
- **Inheritance Hierarchy**: 
  - `Vehicle` ‚Üí `Car` ‚Üí `ElectricCar` (multi-level inheritance)
  - `Vehicle` ‚Üí `Motorcycle`
  - `Vehicle` ‚Üí `Truck`
- **Multiple Interface Implementation**: Classes implementing both `Drivable` and `Maintainable`
- **Access Modifiers**: public, private, protected members
- **Static Members**: Class-level tracking (e.g., total vehicles count)
- **Abstract Methods**: Requiring implementation in subclasses

This demo displays all of Raven's visualization features including class relationships, inheritance arrows, and interface implementations.
