Raven is an upcoming tool to be used alongside your favorite IDE that will help you to visualize and organize your Java projects. It will do this by giving you a high level view of your project’s packages, classes, methods, and attributes in a class diagram graph, and allow for extremely easy navigation and organization of a codebase without having to dig through folders and files. Users will be able to jump to any part of their codebase in their chosen IDE by navigating this graph, so you can think of Raven as an alternative for your OS’s or IDE’s file explorer when working in a Java project. Raven will also have support for creation and editing of packages, classes, methods, and attributes, as well as the organization of these. It will also allow its user to easily generate and edit javadocs belonging to a particular method or class. We also have plans to add support for other languages in the future. Stay tuned!
